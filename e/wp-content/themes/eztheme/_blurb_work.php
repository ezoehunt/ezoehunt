<p>I began my career in technology as a front-end web developer. I quickly realized that I wanted to have greater impact on the product I was building, so I began learning about design and user experience. My self&#8209;education led to other roles where I learned even more: instructional designer, information architect, interaction designer, and creative director.</p>

<p>Over the past ten years, I've worked with both agencies and product companies/start-ups, and my work covers several industries, including e&#8209;commerce, automotive, financial services, lifestyle, and travel.</p>

<p>In 2012 I had the honor of being selected as a <a class="" href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/about" target="_blank" title="Go to Code for America">Code for America Fellow</a>. Since then I've become a bit of a gov&#8209;geek, and I continue to design (and make) civic projects in my spare time.</p>
