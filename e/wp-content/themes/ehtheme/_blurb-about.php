<p>Inspired by the ways great UX simplifies the complex. Equally committed to making things and thinking about them. Theory and practice, with a healthy dose of creativity and imagination.</p>

<p>Recovering academic (Ph.D. English Lit) who landed, by happy accident, in the technology world &#8212; first as a frontâ€‘end developer, later as a UX designer.</p>

<p><b>Currently looking for new opportunities to create meaningful experiences that improve people's lives. <a class="work" title="Get in touch!" href="mailto:<?php echo antispambot("eh@ezoehunt.com"); ?>">Please get in touch!</a></b></p>

<p>I began my career in technology as a front-end web developer. I quickly realized that I wanted to have greater impact on the product I was building, so I began learning about design and user experience. My self&#8209;education led to other roles where I learned even more: instructional designer, information architect, interaction designer, and creative director.</p>

<p>Over the past ten years, I've worked with both agencies and product companies/start-ups, and my work covers several industries, including e&#8209;commerce, automotive, financial services, lifestyle, and travel.</p>

<p>In 2012 I had the honor of being selected as a <a class="work" title="Go to Code for America" href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/about" target="_blank">Code for America Fellow</a>. Since then I've become a bit of a gov&#8209;geek, and I continue to design (and make) civic projects in my spare time.</p>
